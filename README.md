# Algortihms-DSAD
The content here is what I learned from https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/. Thank you to this website; it explains things very well.

So for solving DSA problem here are some trics or we say Strategies  

1.  An Incremental aproch using single or nested loop
    a. Increment Centric
    b. Output Centric
    c. Iterative Improvement 
    Here we solve some probles like
    1. Bubble sort: a. Using Nested for loops b. We optimized nested for loops using a variable 
    2. Selection Sort: Using Nested for loops
    3. Insertion Sort: Using Nested for and while loops
