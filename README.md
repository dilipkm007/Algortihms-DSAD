# Algortihms-DSAD
The content here is what I learned from https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/. Thank you to this website; it explains things very well.

So for solving DSA problem here are some trics or we say Strategies  

1.  An Incremental aproch using single or nested loop
    a. Increment Centric
    b. Output Centric
    c. Iterative Improvement 
    Here we solve some probles like
    1. Bubble sort: a. Using Nested for loops b. We optimized nested for loops using a variable 
    2. Selection Sort: Using Nested for loops
    3. Insertion Sort: Using Nested for and while loops
2. Decrease And Conquer Approch: Finding the solution to given problem via its one sub-problem solution. Mostly use recursive algorithms until the problem become small enough to solve.
    1. Euclid Algorithm to finding GCD
    

3. Two Pointers Approch
    The two pointer approch help us optimize time and space complexity in case of many searching problem on Array and Linkedlist.
    a. Pointer moving in the same direction with same pace 
        1. Merging Two sorted array
        2. Intersection of two arrays
        3. Checking array is subset of another array
